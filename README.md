# HLAPerformance: Different Performance Evaluation Experiments for HLA RTIs

This repo holds the used implementations for the paper "Performance Evaluation of
HLA RTI Implementations" that was submitted to "The 24th International Symposium on
Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications" (DS-RT20).

Feel free to reproduce the results, extend the testcases, or use it as a starting point into the world of the High Level Architecture.
